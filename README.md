# survival <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="120" />

This is the source code for the "survival" package in R.  It gets posted to the comprehensive R archive (CRAN) at intervals, each such posting preceded a throrough test. (I run the test suite for all 800+ packages that depend on survival.)  In general, each new push to CRAN will update the second term of the version number, e.g. 2.40-5 to 2.41-0.  Updates only to the github source increment after the dash.  (If an error is found in the process of CRAN submission then the published CRAN version may be x.yy-1 or even x.yy-2 or 3.) (I of course have local working and test versions, which is where I would pull suggested updates to check them out.)

The vignette2 directory contains material that is not posted to CRAN. The file "tutorial.Rnw", for instance, requires data from the mstate package.  Survival is a recommended package, and such packages can only depend on other recommended packages.  (This allows for a consistent distribution bundle.)  The sas.Rnw vignette has a discussion of compute time and takes too long to run, etc.  This will shortly be moved to a separate survivalVignettes package.

A large portion of the source is found in the noweb directory, and is based on the literate programming ideas of Knuth. Any file in the R or src directories that starts with an "automatically generated ..." comment should NOT be modified directly, instead work with the noweb source. Note that good practice would be to make derived files such as R/tmerge.R "on the fly" using a configure script; that way there would not be a danger of someone trying to modify the derived file rather than the actual source (noweb/tmerge.Rnw).  However, I was not able to create a configure file that worked reliably on all platforms, and voted for usability rather than purity.

However, much as I like the noweb approach, it is clear that very few have adopted it. Thus I will be migrating away as modifications are made to routines, this has already happened with psuedo and residuals.survfit.  The extended information on formulas and algorithms will be gathered in the methods vignette.  The noweb directory will shrink over time.
